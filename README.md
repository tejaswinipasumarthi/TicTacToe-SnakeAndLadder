# TicTacToe-SnakeAndLadder
This project is a Java-based Game Hub that allows players to enjoy two classic games—Tic-Tac-Toe and Snake and Ladder—within a single console application. The program provides a simple text-based interface where players can interactively play against each other, track their moves, and view game history.
